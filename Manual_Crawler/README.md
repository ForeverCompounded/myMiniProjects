NOTE: This application was my first attempt at using Selenium. DO NOT use it for nefarious actions.
Currently set to crawl Lightshot using Selenium browser extension. Will pre-generate a list of links to visit, then use the website CSS to find an image, downloads the binary with requests as a PNG.


Requires download of web driver for Chrome. The directory is currently hard coded in.
